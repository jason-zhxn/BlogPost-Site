Creative portion:
We implemented a my posts section so that someone can access the articles they posted in one space! This would allow people to check all of their posted articles and open them from one place. 

We also implemented an upvote system so that articles can get upvotes that will be displayed on the home page for everyone to see! You can only upvote if you are logged into an account, and you can upvote as many times as you like if you are super passionate about a certain article!
