In this project, a user can login or create an account with secure encryption. The login system prevents attacks with salted hashing, CSRF tokens, input filtering, and output escaping. Users that aren't logged in can still access the site but can only view stories and comments. When logged in, users can post and upvote stories, comment on stories, and access a page that compiles all their posts. Stories and comments that are posted by the currently logged in user can also be deleted and edited. This project utilizes mysql database manipulation and is written in mostly php and html.
